# Direct
### The Intent-Centric Orchestration Layer for a Chain-Abstracted Future.

**Direct** acts as the invisible execution layer for the next generation of Web3 users by completely abstracting away the friction of fragmented bridges and complex swap UIs into a single, AI-native intent commander. Built from the ground up to solve the "User Education" bottleneck, it transforms messy natural language into high-fidelity atomic execution plans that operate autonomously in the background.

## The Vision: Invisible Web3
Currently, "using DeFi" is a technical chore where users must navigate fragmented liquidity, manage gas across multiple chains, and decipher complex bridging protocols. **Direct** delivers the "Uber moment" for DeFi—a reality where the technical rails of Arbitrum and Base effectively disappear, and only the user's intent matters. By moving from "Interaction" to "Intent," we enable users to execute complex multi-chain strategies—like optimizing yields or rebalancing portfolios—without ever seeing a bridge UI or a transaction hash.

## Core Architecture

Direct is engineered around a philosophy of **deterministic execution** and **protocol decoupling**.

### The Intent Engine (AI Reasoning)
Powered by **DeepSeek**, our engine maps natural language prompts to strictly-validated TypeScript interfaces. This ensures that the AI functions as a precise parser rather than a generative black box, effectively neutralizing the risk of on-chain "hallucinations."

### Workflow Orchestrator (The Commander)
The Orchestrator deconstructs high-level intents into a sequence of atomic steps. It manages state synchronization across multi-chain environments (Base Sepolia & Arbitrum Sepolia), ensuring that complex sequences are executed in a strict, logical flow.

### Modular Skill Registry (Protocol Handlers)
We've encapsulated every protocol into a standalone "Skill" class, allowing for rapid scaling and deep protocol integration:
